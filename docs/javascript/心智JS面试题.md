## Design Patterns

### Singleton: are classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally.

### Proxy: can help us get more control over the interactions with certain objects.

### Provider: give the components that need access to the value of data directly.

### Prototype: share properties among many objects of the same type.

### Container/Presentational: enforce separation of concerns.

### Observer: subscribe certain objects, obervers notifies all its observers!

### Moddle: split up your code into smaller, reusable pieces.

### Mixin: Add functionality to objects or classed without inheritance.

### Mediator/Middleware: use a certral mediator object to handle communication between components

### HOC: pass reusable logic down as props to components throughout your application.

### Render Props: Pass JSX elements to components through props.

### Hooks: use functions to reuse stateful logic among multiple components throughout the app.

### Flyweight: reuse existing instances when working with identical objects.

### Factory: use a factory function in order to create objects.

### Compound: create multiple components that work together to perform a single task.

### Command: Decouple methods that execute tasks by sending commands to a commander.
